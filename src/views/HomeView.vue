        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Born in 1982</b> in France, I started getting interested in
          computers when I was <b>nine</b> as my older brother got an Amstrad
          CPC 6128 for his birthday. Soon after, I embarked on the 'programming'
          journey with him soon after by shamelessly copying code found in
          computer magazines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time passed and I started learning C then <b>C++</b> on an intel 80386
          mainly trying to reproduce games like Bomberman. As the 3D
          acceleration cards price started to fall in the 90s with the like of
          the Voodoo 3dfx I created some games using OpenGL and understood the
          importance of mathematicss at a practical level with matrix calculus
          in particular. This led me to prepare entry for the French Engineering
          schools providing me a degree in ... Telecommunications. Indeed, it
          was all the rage at the time and I got dragged into the hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, programming tracked me down, and after four years as a
          consultant in Telecommunications, I started developing professionally
          in various entities such as
          <b>consulting and software development companies</b>,
          <b>educational institutions</b> and
          <b>decentralized autonomous organizations</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked now for <b>12 years</b> into
          <b>software development</b> activities and in many different
          situations, I feel like I have not even started scratching the surface
          of this field. Consequently, I do not consider myself an expert of any
          particular language nor framework. However I feel like I have tested
          my <b>ability to adapt</b> to the limit.
        </p>

        <h1>Development languages</h1>
        <p>
          Working in various companies gave me the opportunity to use many
          languages and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used the <b>JAVA</b> programming language in many contexts, first
          using JSP and servlets, then <b>Spring</b> and
          <b>VertX frameworks</b>. I also deployed applications on various
          application servers such as <b>Tomcat</b>, <b>JBoss</b> and
          <b>Jetty</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using CMSes and Frameworks like Drupal, Wordpress and Laravel, I am
          also familiar with <b>PHP</b> and web server configuration such as
          Apache and Nginx.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also developped modules for Redmine which allowed me to dip my toes
          into <b>Ruby and Rails</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created many applications and web-services using <b>Django</b> and
          sometimes django-rest-framework for the backend and Vue.js for the
          frontend. Consequently, I acquired serious experience with
          <b>Python</b> in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all my projects, I developed both the back-end and the front-end.
          This enabled me to also progress in the various Web technologies, ie.
          <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>Typescript</b>,
          <b>Vue.js</b>, <b>Angular</b>, and lately <b>React</b>.

        <h1>System administration</h1>
        <p>
          I mostly worked in small teams. Thus, I had to acquire a set of system
          administration skills to %3C%3Cget%20things%20done%3E%3E.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular I feel confident with <b>Centos 7 & 8</b> system
          administration, application installation and configuration in general.
          I also worked on some occasion on the <b>Debian</b> operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particular applications I remember having configured include
          <b>Apache</b>, <b>Nginx</b>, as web-servers, reverse proxies or WSGI
          servers but also <b>Tomcat</b>, <b>Jenkins</b>, <b>Sonarqube</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover I worked on configuring the continuous integration systems on
          my latest projects using <b>Jenkins</b> and <b>Github</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having installed and configured a small privately hosted
          <b>Kubernetes</b>
          cluster in the context of a production grade microlearning
          application, I also feel confident working with that technology.

        <h1>Other skills</h1>
        <p>
          Since I worked in small companies and having a background in
          consulting, I could develop other skills, in particular: Requirement
          analysis, Project management and Change management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most recently, as the technical lead of my latest project. I crafted a
          tailored <b>Agile</b> framework inspired from <b>Scrum</b> but adapted
          to the very specific environnement the team is working in.

      <div class="one half animated bounceInRight triple-padded">
        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
          In no specific order: Roller hockey, Board games, Macro economy,
          Blockchains, Video games.
