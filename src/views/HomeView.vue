        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Born in 1982 in France, I started getting interrested in computers
          when I was 9 as my older brother got an Amstrad CPC 6128 for his
          birthday. I started 'programming' with him soon after by copying code
          found in computer magazines.
        </p>

          Time passed and I started learning C then C++ on an intel 80386 mainly
          trying to reproduce games like Bomberman. As the 3D acceleration cards
          got democratize in the 90s with the like of the Voodoo 3dfx I created
          some games using OpenGL and understood the importance of maths at a
          practical level with matrix calculus in particular. This led me to
          prepare entry for the French Engineeringing schools after which I
          ended up with a degree in... Telecommunications. Indeed it was all the
          rage at the time and I got dragged into the hype.
        </p>

          Nevertheless, computers tracked me down, and after 4 years as a
          Consultant in Telecommunications, I started developping
          professionnally in various entities such as consulting and software
          development companies, educationnal institutions and decentralized
          autonomous organizations.
        </p>
        I am now 12 years into software development activities and I feel like I
        have not started scratching the surface of this field.
