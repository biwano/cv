        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Born in 1982 in France, I started getting interrested in computers
          when I was 9 as my older brother got an Amstrad CPC 6128 for his
          birthday. Soon after, I embarked into the 'programming' journey with
          him soon after by shamelessly copying code found in computer
          magazines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time passed and I started learning C then C++ on an intel 80386 mainly
          trying to reproduce games like Bomberman. As the 3D acceleration cards
          price started to fall in the 90s with the like of the Voodoo 3dfx I
          created some games using OpenGL and understood the importance of maths
          at a practical level with matrix calculus in particular. This led me
          to prepare entry for the French Engineeringing schools after which I
          ended up with a degree in... Telecommunications. Indeed it was all the
          rage at the time and I got dragged into the hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, programming tracked me down, and after 4 years as a
          consultant in Telecommunications, I started developping
          professionnally in various entities such as consulting and software
          development companies, educationnal institutions and decentralized
          autonomous organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked now for 12 years into software development activities
          and in many different situations, I feel like I have not even started
          scratching the surface of this field. Consequently, I do not consider
          myself an expert of any particular language or framework. But I know I
          have tested my ability to adapt to any situation to the limit.

        <h1>Development languages</h1>
        <p>
          Having worked in various companies, I had the opportunity to use many
          languages and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used JAVA in many contexts, first using JSP and servlets then Spring
          and VertX frameworks. I also deployed applications on various
          application servers such as Tomcat and
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked on CMSes and Frameworks like Drupal, Wordpress and
          Laravel, I am also familiar with PHP and webserver configuration such
          as Apache and Nginx.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also developped modules for Redmine which had given me the
          opportunity to dip my toes into Ruby and Rails.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created many applications and webservices using Django and sometimes
          django-rest-framework for the backend and Vuejs for the frontend.
          Consequently, I acquired serious experience with Python Python in
          general
        </p>
        <p>
          In all my projects I developped both the backend and the frontend of
          the applications, this enabled me to progress in the Web technologies,
          ie. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, VueJS, Angular, and lately a
          little bit of React.

        <h1>System adminitration</h1>
        <p>
          I mostly worked in small teams. So I had to acquire a set of skills in
          the System's administration field to 'get things done'
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular I feel fluent with Centos 7 & 8 system administration
          and application installation and configuration in general. I also
          worked a little bit on Debian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particular applications I remember having configured include apache,
          nginx, as webservers/reverse proxies/wsgi servers, Tomcat, Jenkins,
          Sonarkube.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover I worked on configuring the continuous integration systems on
          my latest projects using Jenkins and Github.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having installed and configured a small self hosted Kubernetes cluster
          in the context of a public microlearning application, I also feel
          confident working with that technology
        </p>

        <h1>Other skills</h1>
        <p>
          As the technical lead of my latest project. I crafted a tailored agile
          framework inspired from scrum but adapted to the very specific
          environnement we are working in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I worked in small companies and having a background in
          consulting, I also had the opportunity to do the other jobs around
          software developpers: Requirement analysis, Project management, Change
          management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could be wrong, but I think but people usually find me easy to work
          with.
